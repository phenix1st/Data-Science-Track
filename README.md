📊 Data Scientist Track Progress
This repository documents my learning journey through the Data Scientist Career Track on [DataCamp]. It contains notes, exercises, projects, and datasets I’ve worked on while building core data science skills.

The track covers:

🐍 Python for Data Science – data structures, control flow, functions, and OOP

📈 Data Manipulation – Pandas, NumPy, data wrangling, and cleaning

📊 Data Visualization – Matplotlib, Seaborn, and storytelling with data

📉 Statistics & Probability – hypothesis testing, regression, and inference

🤖 Machine Learning – supervised and unsupervised learning techniques

🛠️ Projects & Case Studies – applying skills to real-world datasets

💡 This repo reflects continuous growth in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and coding for data-driven solutions.
