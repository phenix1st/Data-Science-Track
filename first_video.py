It's 3 AM and you're on-call for TravelBuddy. Your phone buzzes with an urgent alert—the system is failing for several users. You check the error log and see this message:

🚨 TRAVELBUDDY ERROR REPORT 🚨

User said: "I need somewhere quiet for my anniversary, maybe Europe?"

What went wrong: 
❌ Couldn't understand what the user wants
❌ Don't know what "anniversary" means in this context  
❌ Can't figure out that "quiet" relates to hotel preferences
❌ Unable to process this request

Status: TravelBuddy is confused and can't help this user
